## Introduction

In this lab, a design was implemented on the FPGA to create a set of multiplexed seven-segment displays. Two PNP transistors were used to oscillate between the two displays so they could be driven from a single set of GPIO pins.  

## Design and Testing Methodology

In order to oscillate between the two displays, the on-board FPGA high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) was used. Additonaly a counter variable was used to reduce the frequency of the signal to a usable level. This signal was then used to control the base signal of two PNP transistors that each controlled the power to one of the seven-segment displays. The counter variable bit size was incrementally increased until just before a flicker was visible in the displays. This was done to allow the maximum time for the FPGA to perform its logic between each cycle.

To control the hex value of each display, a pair of 4-pin dip switches were used. One pre-soldered onto the development board, and one plugged into the breadboard. A multiplexer was implemented in the SystemVerilog code to switch the control between from one set of switches to the other on each oscillation cycle.

Finally, the sum of the two digits was computed in SystemVerilog and displayed in binary on five LEDs surface-mounted to the development board.
