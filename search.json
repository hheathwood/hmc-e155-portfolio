    "text": "Design and Testing Methodology\nIn order to oscillate between the two displays, the on-board FPGA high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) was used. Additonaly a counter variable was used to reduce the frequency of the signal to a usable level. This signal was then used to control the base signal of two PNP transistors that each controlled the power to one of the seven-segment displays. The counter variable bit size was incrementally increased until just before a flicker was visible in the displays. This was done to allow the maximum time for the FPGA to perform its logic between each cycle.\nTo control the hexidecimal value of each display, a pair of 4-pin dip switches were used. One pre-soldered onto the development board, and one plugged into the breadboard. A multiplexer was implemented in the SystemVerilog code to switch the control between from one set of switches to the other on each oscillation cycle.\nFinally, the sum of the two digits was computed in SystemVerilog and displayed in binary on five LEDs surface-mounted to the development board."

The top-level module contains three sub-level moduels: the high-speed oscillator block (HSOSC), the seven-segment decoder module, and the sum logic module.\n\n\nSchematic\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Schematic for Lab 2\n\n\nThe circuit schematic in Figure 2 displays the physical circuit layout of the design. The cathodes of the seven-segment display are connected to seven FPGA pins through 220 kΩ resistors. The anodes are connected to power through two PNP transistors controlled by the FPGA. A 4-pin dip switch is added, in addition to the one pre-mounted on the development board, to control the second digit of the display. Finally, five surface mounted LEDs are used to display the sum of the two hexidecimal digits in binary."

    "text": "Results and Discussion\nThe design met all intended objectives. The design would’ve been more solid if the development board had a second pre-soldered 4-pin dip switch, as the one plugged into the breadboard doesn’t fit super well and sometimes causes glitches in the display."

    "text": "Lab 1 Reflection\nThis first lab really challenged me in E155. Going into it, I had little to no experince with Git or GitHub. I had lots of experience soldering, although not with surface-mounted components, so this initial portion was not too bad. However, my first real challenge started with just the setup of Git and GitHub. My lack of experience made it difficult to make any progress on my own. While everyone else around me was already working on writing their verilog, I was still stuck setting up my git and file structure. Everyone also seemed to be struggling with the verliog, which just worried me further.\nWith some assistance from Kavi Dey, one of the course tutors, and Prof. Brake, the instructor for the course, I was eventually able to push past these inital roadblocks and finish the lab. This lab taught me to not compare my progress to the progress of others, as everybody has their own strengths and weakness."
